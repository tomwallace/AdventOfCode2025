This project is a Java implementation of the 2025 Advent of Code puzzles, written by Eric Wastl.  The basic concept is that the author presents two problems a day from December 1 until December 25, for a total of 50 problems (an advent calendar of code problems).  The problems are self-contained with the second problem of each day being based on the first problem, with a twist.  The problems are appropriate for a variety of developer skill levels and are rather witty and fun.  You can learn more about Advent of Code here:
